# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a modified version of the Tic Tac Toe game originally created by [russs123](https://github.com/russs123). The [original project](https://github.com/russs123/TicTacToe/blob/master/tictactoe.py) implements a simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game using pygame. In my version, I've made several improvements and added new features. It's my first project, as well as my first time using pygame and i just wanted to improve it for fun so that i can learn more about pygame andabout how github works.

Changes:
- Added 'Player vs AI' gamemode
- Added starting menu
- Changed all the colors of the UIs
- Clickable buttons change colors when pressed
- Added settings icon in the top right in case the user wants to change gamemodes
- I used the original game logic as the backbone but overall modified everything
  by converting blocks of code into functions, making new functions or adding other elements to the game
